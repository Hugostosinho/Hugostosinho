- 👀 I’m interested in 3D printers, game development e a little bit of real programming.
- 🧠 I’m currently learning how to make a 3D printer from scratch, electrical concepts, aerodynamics and civil structure.
- ⌨️ I try to collaborate with society in my own way.
- 📫 You can reach me on my social networks which are on my profile.
